# Real-Madrid-24--Season-Analysis--Web-Scraping-

The purpose of this project was to utilize python web scraping to scrape a website of our choice. Using the website, I was asked to brainstorm 5 questions regarding the datasets found on the website and conduct an in depth analysis and visualization to answer these questions. This taught the fundamentals of web scraping and reaffirmed data visualization and analysis skills. The primary focus of my project was to scrape the statistics page of the Real Madrid soccer team 2023-2024 season and answer a series of questions regarding the team itself along with the players. 

The following questions were answered/justified through my work:
1. Who is the best goalkeeper (in terms of saves) on the Real Madrid team in the 2023-2024 season?
2. Who are the best support players (passers) on the team? (successfully completed to attempted pass ratio)
3. Which players hold the ball the longest before passing or shooting (recieves vs. touches ratio)
4. How diverse is the Real Madrid team? (Count of countries)
5. Who is the best challenger on the defensive side of the team (ratio of successfull/unsuccessful challenges)?

Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Seaborn, BeautifulSoup, and Requests were primary aspects of this project. 

Within the contents of this repository can be found the Jupyter Notebook file. Within the notebook is the code, analysis, and visualization (all documented) that show the process led me to my conclusions.

Note: Due to the website used in this project, new csv files were not made and altered in the creation of pandas dataframes. This is because the website had already cleaned data that needed no alteration to be done.
